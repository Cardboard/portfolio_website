<p>as a <em>third-party observer of matthew</em>, i can see from the way he sticks his tongue out --- when he draws, makes music, and writes --- that he must be passionate about all of these things. and anything else that he does.</p>
<p>i have certainly found this fire of his to be both hot and all-consuming. however, he has a tough time forcing himself to care about things he doesn&#39;t believe to be worth his time. <em>however</em>, he is also pretty good at making himself interested in new things.</p>
<p>here are a few things i believe that matthew believes are not worth his time (take these with a grain of salt, since i myself am not matthew):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>copying styles that already exist in the hands of large numbers of artists because they&#39;re &quot;trendy&quot; or easily digested.</strong> if it&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; to see a work of art is good or will make money, it&#39;s probably boring and pushes absolutely zero boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>working from sunrise to sunset (or later).</strong> matthew much prefers a segmented work schedule where he can work when he is most inspired and least tired. this usually involves doing solid work in the morning, walking or exercising while the sun is still shining, and then hunkering down and getting more work done at night. staying up extra late is something matthew is not opposed to. however, he doesn&#39;t believe that staying up each and every night is productive, or healthy. <em>rest</em> is as important to creativity as are both <em>creating</em> and <em>consuming</em> art, music, and literature.</li>
<li><strong>social media.</strong> judging from his social media habits --- brief spurts of content, followed  by extended silence --- i imagine that matthew is opposed to the currently popular &quot;share anything and everything <em>with everyone</em>&quot; culture, and prefers to both create <strong>and</strong> share for a smaller audience of closer friends and family, or for individuals or companies he believes in. he doesn&#39;t need recognition or fame. in fact, he would prefer neither. he wants only to leave a lasting impression on those who are dear to him.</li>
</ol>
<p>matthew enjoys most things that don&#39;t involve large groups of people, schmoozing, or meetings. matthew occasionally hangs out with friends at home, around town, or via the internet. more often than not, he&#39;s content exploring the endless opportunities available in and around his place of residence.</p>
<p>matthew often tells me of his dreams. he hopes to one day have a &quot;tiny house recording studio&quot; (whatever that means) situated somewhere in the large expanse of land between himself and his best friends who live elsewhere. this tiny house would serve as a recording studio, but it would also be a nice, homely place to for him or any of his friends to escape to whenever necessary. </p>
<p>another dream of his is to travel to places that would probably be overlooked by most people as they pass by them on their way to somewhere more notable --- the old, family-owned diners in tiny towns or the shops and museums on the fringes of society, run by people more concerned with preserving history, or with family &amp; friends, than racing to achieve the same &quot;success&quot; everyone else is.</p>
<p>matthew wants to read more often, but he usually cannot bring himself to stop creating things or <em>thinking about</em> creating things in order to actually do so. he needs to learn to relax &amp; slow down, but he&#39;ll get there, i think.</p>
