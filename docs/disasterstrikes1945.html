<p><strong>DISASTER STRIKES 1945</strong></p>
<p>i feel so bad / i fall asleep on the floor / i wake up tired and / i don&#39;t work anymore
i miss old summers / and hearing fans / after i died at practice / and stared at the stands
if you ever wake up / feeling happy / take a good look / and get started laughing
play games with brothers / friends and lovers / in the park / remaining undiscovered</p>
<p>disaster strikes / 1945 / i get hit by the enemy / but never run out of life
freedom still stands / tall and matte-black / covered in knickknacks / a humming symbol (sitting in the back) of --- the time that&#39;s passed us by</p>
<p>take your time / with a grain of salt / before dinnertime / or when you feel your mind halt
picture frames / fill the walls with life / though they appear to be old / they understand what it&#39;s like to
live forever / in a single moment / everything that we&#39;ve worked for / is it always present?
we only live / in what we leave behind / in the physical world / in other people&#39;s minds</p>
