<p>after she drowned</p>
<p>   she began to hide her body</p>
<pre><code>   behind peeling wallpaper

   in abandoned houses where

       floors creak

       mice scurry

           along broken floorboards

       wind enters and leaves

    in old forgotten forests

        behind dead tree stumps

        and the tall grass

    in aquarium tanks

        behind expanses of water

        dew drops from leaves

            ripples above her presence



    for ever

        which wasn&#39;t very long

        after she drowned
