<p><strong>ice cream trucks spread consumerism</strong></p>
<p>man on the bicycle</p>
<p>how do you feel </p>
<p>as you&#39;re riding downtown</p>
<p>through the city of steel</p>
<p>and you look all around</p>
<p>and all you see are frowns</p>
<p>and you think to yourself â€¦ damn</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i am the ice cream man</p>
<p>i sell ice cream</p>
<p>comes in all flavors</p>
<p>try one it&#39;s so good you&#39;ll see</p>
<p>a world of possibility</p>
<p>endless combinations</p>
<p>in a cone or in a cup</p>
<p>i roam all over the nation!    </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>watch me fly across the purple mountains</p>
<p>watch me swim through the shining seas</p>
<p>i&#39;m an eagle with four generic wheels</p>
<p>look to the sky, if you want to see me</p>
