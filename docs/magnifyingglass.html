<p><strong>magnifying glass</strong></p>
<p>macrobius couldn&#39;t figure out the tides /
now we send our people to antarctica /
thanks to wallace and his dog /
we know we&#39;ve been wrong all along /</p>
<p>maps and treasure hiding on our shelves /
people, places, things, &amp; other hells / 
is it not crazy that we all are geniuses? /
hiding in our pockets &amp; pretending we agree with this /</p>
<p>everything that we have ever seen / 
is so much goddam true-er when we see it on a screen / 
these magnifying glasses only used for fires /
could be put to better use, burning holes in liars / 
there are worlds alive with creatures i admire / 
there are coffee cups with patterns that inspire / 
hands are better unfurled and reaching towards the sky / 
rain, sleet, and snow, are all worth more than your mind /</p>
<p>walden is worlds away and a worthless visit /
a mental portrait&#39;s the real deal is it? /
a western ghost town made of wood /
i guess i&#39;ve unknowingly been up to no good /</p>
<p>do you know how hard it is /
to see every thing you&#39;ve ever missed /
i understand that everything i&#39;ve ever done can see / 
what i&#39;ve become and how i ended up eventually /</p>
<p>building fortresses from giant one-way windows /
stagnant saturdays, listen as the wind blows /
warmer times have whispered here before that even /
empty space like that you&#39;re in right now can be an open door (stay put!)</p>
<p>everything that we have ever seen / 
is so much goddam true-er when we see it on a screen / 
these magnifying glasses only used for fires /
could be put to better use, burning holes in liars / 
there are worlds alive with creatures i admire / 
there are coffee cups with patterns that inspire / 
hands are better unfurled and reaching towards the sky / 
rain, sleet, and snow, are all worth more than your mind /</p>
