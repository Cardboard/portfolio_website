<p><strong>The Old Man and the Hare in the Canoe</strong></p>
<p>I am sitting here on a boulder near a lake. But not too near to the lake. I am looking down on the lake from a vantage point which is quite high thanks to the surrounding hills. It is the middle of the day. The time of day when the sun is out but not late enough to cause one to start worrying about the next day. The sky is the usual blue hue and the large boulder I am sitting on is warm. It isn’t all that breezy so I’m sweating a bit. But the sweat isn’t running and it isn’t profuse. I’m just a bit too warm I guess.</p>
<p>In front of me a great distance and with his back to me is some old white hair sitting atop an old man’s head which rests atop an old man’s body. Stooping over a canoe of some sort he whistles a little tune. He must be fixing or inspecting it. But I can’t really tell and don’t know anything about canoes. A small hare approaches him and he either does not notice or does not seem to care as he goes about whistling and fidgeting above the canoe. The hare approaches cautiously at first but soon the hare is sitting in front of him within his reach. The canoe seems to be completely in tact so maybe he is just pretending to be occupied so that animals will feel comfortable approaching him. That would make sense.</p>
<p>I think people generally don’t feel comfortable befriending those who appear to be actively seeking friendship with them. It has to be a much more disinterested thing. And both parties must be disinterested not just one. One must befriend someone on accident or because they have to or else not at all. Animals must be the same. The hare must have sought out this man not because it needed friends but because it needed the man for some reason. Or maybe it was only just wandering around this barren landscape and upon coming close enough to the lake was able to see and become curious about the occupied old man who hovered around and worked on his canoe all day until he left his canoe docked and wandered off in some random direction each night. And then from this curiosity sprung the chance for the two to possibly foster a relationship. Or not. Only by repeatedly running into the man will this hare be able to be sufficiently acquainted with this man. Otherwise they will just go their own ways soon.</p>
<p>The man turns around and sees the hare but you wouldn’t know that he saw anything by the way his facial expression does not change at all. The hare fidgets a bit as expected. It probably didn’t want to instigate something right away for fear of seeming too decisive. Decisiveness is not the way to become good friends with anyone. “Do you want to go here or do such and such?” “Yes let’s go to the lake for about an hour and skip rocks.” No. You can’t do that. You must first humm and haww and finally settle on “Uh what if we went somewhere and did something.” And then they would agree and bolden the plans just a tiny bit. “Oh yes let’s go somewhere for an hour.” Being now your turn again you might say “Would it be fun if we went to the lake for an hour?” You know of course that it could very well be fun. But it’s expected that you remain hesitant and unsure of yourself until you really get to know someone. Only then can the windows to your soul be very slightly opened which will only slightly permit the exchange of air between your inner self and the outside world. Finally the other party will say once you arrive at the lake “We should skip rocks that might be fun!”</p>
<p>The hare then points a paw toward his canoe and the man pauses a bit and bites his lip as if in thought. He says “get in if you want” and the hare gets into the canoe. The hare makes sure to look around as if deciding where it sat were an important decision to make. The man waits because he thinks the hare actually has a preference for where it sits. The hare sits down and fidgets a bit in order to signal subconsciously to the old man that the hare is alive and has thoughts of its own and is not intent on mindlessly sitting for the duration of their ride. Neither party is aware of this message consciously but the hare sends it and the old man obviously receives it because he puts on a brief and fake smile in order to signal to the hare that he also is alive and has thoughts of his own and is not simply a robot who moves in some circumstances but not in others. Now that all that is cleared up the man begins to row. He grabs his paddle slowly because he is in no hurry. He pushes off the shore with his paddle and they are on their way. On their way to somewhere.</p>
<p>I cannot see the end of the lake to the left or right or in the forward direction but I have heard one can cross it and the man has a canoe so I’ll choose to believe it. The other side must be worthwhile if a hare finds it worthwhile to slowly canoe across the lake and experience a lot of blue and sitting motionless instead of going around it on foot and experiencing the uneasy warmth and uncomfortable exercise. Not that the lake must be crossed at all. The hare could choose to sit on this side of the lake for the time that would be spent in the boat. But how often does one spend time thinking about good or new things unless one is in a unique or different situation than usual? Maybe the hare is aware of this. The hare might not find itself stimulated out there in the canoe on the lake but I am sure it is a nice break from the warmth of the dirt and rocks and sparse foliage regardless. And from searching for food and shade which is something I guess hares have to do. The hare will inevitably have to seek food and new shelter again once it reaches the other side but for now it can relax and have idle thoughts. Or perhaps it thinks of the particular ways in which it will search for food or shelter once it reaches the other side. It probably does a bit of each. Some relaxing and some thinking. The man seems completely engaged in getting the canoe across the lake. I’m sure he must be thinking though even if his face isn’t straining or if he isn’t biting his lip or anything. I can’t see his face so I can’t be sure what he is doing with his face but I am certain it must be doing something other than staring blankly ahead.</p>
<p>After a while I can no longer see them. I hope the hare is able to make a life for itself on the other side. Well maybe they are still sailing actually or maybe they won’t make it anywhere before they decide to turn back and undo their physical progress. In that case I’ll be waiting to see them unless it gets too dark before then and I have to go home for the day. If they came back when it was dark I wouldn’t be able to see them anyway. I could hear them but I’m not as excited about hearing things as I am about seeing them. I have a friend who likes to hear things though. That’s what floats his boat I guess. I wouldn’t consider it a waste to have sat here all day as the boulder underneath me cools as the wind picks up and becomes colder because I’ll have had a lot of thoughts about this particular old man and this particular hare. Nobody else has had these thoughts as far as I am aware and nobody ever will have these same thoughts. I could have had other thoughts today if I had gone somewhere else but I think coming here was a good decision. I liked what I saw and even now when I can no longer see the old man and the hare I know that they are out there somewhere. And I only know that they are out there because I was able to see them before they departed. I wonder if they’re friends.</p>
