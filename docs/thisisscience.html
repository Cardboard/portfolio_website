<p><strong>this is science</strong></p>
<p>wandering under</p>
<p>palaces made of</p>
<p>copper and iron</p>
<p>covered in thick dust</p>
<p>staring at bridges</p>
<p>feel as wind blows</p>
<p>wading through rivers</p>
<p>up to our elbows</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>burn me up it&#39;s a hundred degrees</p>
<p>sitting out here with the willowing trees</p>
<p>suns out fun&#39;s out swatting at flies</p>
<p>fight me baby think it&#39;s time that i die</p>
<p>light a match, burn your work</p>
<p>take a left turn at the fork</p>
<p>life goes on it&#39;s written in the sky</p>
<p>with a big blue marker in the terrible light</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>everything we work for</p>
<p>is it what we want?</p>
<p>science makes us learn stuff</p>
<p>are we better off?</p>
<p>dreaming of disaster</p>
<p>in these wretched holes</p>
<p>feelings wait till after</p>
<p>everything unfolds</p>
