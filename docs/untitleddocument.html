<p>I&#39;m writing to you by the light of five mushrooms.</p>
<p>I&#39;m out here somewhere if you&#39;d care to look —</p>
<p>if you&#39;d dare take a look.</p>
<p>I&#39;m out here in wild nature.
-</p>
<p>Watch your steps,</p>
<p>where they fall,</p>
<p>as you make your way through foliage I&#39;ve trampled.</p>
<p>Long ago I made my way,</p>
<p>by moonlight and sunlight,</p>
<p>through the forest,</p>
<p>the trees,</p>
<p>through life.</p>
<p>I&#39;m embedded in the vines now, if you can believe that.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>We all are.</p>
<p>The green you exude in life grows</p>
<p>forests in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>How neat is that!</p>
<p>Firmly locate your feet —</p>
<p>in dampened dusk boots</p>
<p>— in the moist recesses of</p>
<p>abundant nature,</p>
<p>until you find me.</p>
