<p><strong>Vaccinium myrtillus</strong></p>
<p>tent set up</p>
<p>rather than rage rapids, i&#39;ll roam where i</p>
<p>am, left in outfields where mothers creak</p>
<p>tires screech &amp; my friends were never here </p>
<p>for me i am asphalt trodden over gently once or</p>
<p> twice </p>
<p>  forgotten when </p>
<pre><code>   ~ rubber leaves &amp; black soul / roots divine ~
</code></pre><p> a whole lot</p>
<p> of land</p>
<p> of eyes backed by the Federal Reserve System</p>
<p>even in pink donut boxes emptied hands-free using just my voice do</p>
<p>i understand how nothing works</p>
<p>[i just have arms but i&#39;ll pretend i have wings]</p>
<p>all my friends</p>
<p>committing felonies against my self with </p>
<p>butter knives and mirrors</p>
<p> at the same  time jokes are made</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can anyone hate</p>

<p>carefree but full of thoughts of </p>
<p>airtight cabins under magnifying glasses</p>
<p>less than a e s t h e t i c -- keep all rocks in the quarry --</p>
<p>though certainly i&#39;m a ware of drafts under doors i&#39;ve closed</p>
<p>even the one last loved made of</p>
<p>[cedar &amp; jade]</p>
<p>~ heat cracks burning wood as i stare at my shoes &amp; pass out standing ~</p>
<p>stone seven meter giants sitting as solemnly (and in the noonsun) as </p>
<p>u on your greatest ever day in a circle</p>
<p>can any one possibility be greater than the sum of nothing&#39;s parts and all the</p>
<p>kids prone with friends in</p>
<p>[streets are happier than a whole bag of marbles]</p>
<p>tent/puppy put down</p>
<p>[things never grow when they&#39;re in our hearts] </p>
<p>but we can let them go when they&#39;re no longer yellow</p>
<p>i&#39;m not telling you all i&#39;m going through</p>
